# Installation & Setup

This sections explains how to install the RF Analyzer app and connect a source
for RF signals. Details about the configuration of the SDR can be found in the
section [SDR Source](./sdr-source.md).

## Installation

### Installing the App

The app can be downloaded via the Google Play Store. Use the following link:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer)

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer"><p align="center"><img src="./assets/google_play_badge.png" alt="RF Analyzer on Google Play" width="200px"></p></a>


You can try all features for free with a 7-day trial and up to 60 minutes of
analyzer usage.

If you like it, a one-time in-app purchase unlocks the full version - no
subscriptions, no accounts, no ads.

This app is a hobby project, built with passion and countless hours of work.

### Installing the SDR driver (app)

!!! note "This is only necessary for the RTL-SDR"
    RF Analyzer uses the free [RTL-SDR driver app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=marto.rtl_tcp_andro)
    for Android to interface with the RTL-SDR device.

The driver can be installed via Google Play like any other app. After the
installation, nothing more has to be done. It is not necessary to start the
driver app manually. RF Analyzer will run the driver app in the background as
soon as the sampling is started.

The driver is not needed for the HackRF because RF Analyzer uses a build-in driver.

## Connecting SDR Hardware

### HackRF & RTL-SDR via USB

The HackRF and RTL-SDR devices are connected via USB to your Android device
using a [USB OTG adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go). You
might have received such an adapter with your phone as it is usually used to
transfer data from you old phone to the new one.

When connecting the SDR, the RTL-SDR driver app immediatly shows a dialog
requesting permissions to the device.

!!! note "The permission request of the RTL-SDR driver also appears when connecting a HackRF. It can be accepted or dismissed. RF Analyzer will show its own permission dialog when starting the SDR"

RF Analyzer will automatically select RTL-SDR or HackRF as source type when
a respective device is plugged in and the app is currently open.

### RTL-SDR via TCP

The RTL-SDR can be setup on a computer and accessed/operated via the network.
On you host computer, execute `rtl_tcp` to start a SDR server. The following
command line starts the server on TCP port 4242 assuming the IP address of your
host is 192.168.0.42:

```shell
rtl_tcp -a 192.168.0.42 -p 4242
```

Select **RTL-SDR** in the source tab dropdown menu in the RF Analyzer app.
Before starting the analyzer, scroll down and enable **External Server**.
Enter the IP address and port:

Afterwards, start the analyzer by pressing the **Play** Button.

!!! warning "Firewall might block access to the server"
    If your host computer is behind a firewall or has a local firewall
    installed, RF Analyzer might not be able to connect to the port. In this
    case, add an exception to the firewall to allow incoming traffic to the
    port specified in `rtl_tcp`.

### Filesource (Playback recordings and IQ files)

RF Analyzer can playback files that contain captured RF samples in the format
of either RTL-SDR (`rtl_sdr`) or HackRF (`hackrf_transfer -r`):

- RTL-SDR: interleaved, 8-bit, **unsigned** IQ samples
- HackRF: interleaved, 8-bit, **signed** IQ samples

In both cases, the in-phase component (**I**) is first, followed by the quadrature component (**Q**).

Select **Filesource** in the source tab of RF Analyzer. Either choose **Open
File** to open a file from storage or **Recordings** to playback a
previously recorded caputure.

When selecting a file from storage it is important that the frequency, sample
rate and file format (HackRF vs. RTL-SDR) are correctly specified after the
file is opened. If these values are wrong, the file will not play correctly.
RF Analyzer tries to automatically detect these settings from the imported
file name, however, it is not guaranteed that this succeeds. Double check the
values if the data is not correctly played.

## Start the Analyzer

The [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) section briefly explains all necessary steps
receive signals with the app. Detailed information about all UI elements can be
found in the section [User Interface](./ui-overview.md) and the following
sections ([SDR Source](./sdr-source.md), [FFT & Waterfall Display](./fft.md),
[Demodulation](./demodulation.md), [Recording](./recording.md) and
[Settings](./settings.md)).
