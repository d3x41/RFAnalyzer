# User Interface

The app is designed to give you interactive insights into radio signals,
whether you are analyzing live signals from an SDR or replaying recorded IQ
data. The user interface is structured to provide both **real-time spectrum
visualization** and **intuitive controls** to configure your setup.

The UI consists of two main components:

- **FFT and Waterfall Plot** - Displays the real-time frequency spectrum and
  signal history over time.
- **Control Drawer** - Allows you to configure the analyzer, select input
  sources, and manage settings.

## FFT and Waterfall Plot

When the analyzer is running, the **FFT plot** provides a live view of the
frequency spectrum, while the **waterfall plot** gives a history of past
signals, scrolling downwards as new data arrives.

### Interacting with the FFT Plot

You can explore the frequency spectrum in several ways:

- **Scrolling Left/Right** - Move the center frequency up or down.
- **Pinch-to-Zoom** - Adjust the frequency resolution for a more detailed or
  broader view.
- **Power Level Axis** - Located on the left, this shows signal strength in dB.
  It can be scrolled up/down or zoomed using pinch gestures.
- **Autoscale Button** - Found in the FFT Tab ([FFT & Waterfall](./fft.md)),
  this automatically adjusts the vertical dB scale for the best signal
  visibility. The FFT tab also has a button to reset the scale and a slider to
  fine tune the vertical viewport.

The FFT plot is the heart of the RF Analyzer, and these interactive tools help
you navigate and fine-tune your view of the spectrum.

## Control Drawer

The **control drawer** is your main hub for adjusting settings. It appears at
the bottom of the screen (or as a side panel in landscape mode) and can be
expanded or collapsed by dragging.

### Available Tabs

- **[Source](./sdr-source.md)** - Select and configure your signal input.
- **[Demodulation](./demodulation.md)** - Set up signal demodulation (AM, FM, etc.).
- **[Recording](./recording.md)** - Record IQ samples to a file and manage recordings.
- **[Display](./fft.md)** - Adjust FFT and Watterfall display settings like scaling and resolution.
- **[Settings](./settings.md)** - General application preferences.
- **About** - App version, acknowledgments and licencing. Also contains
  purchase options and debug settings.

Letâ€™s start with the [Source Tab](./sdr-source.md), which is the first step in setting up your
analyzer.
